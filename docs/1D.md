# One dimensional UAV problem 

\section{UAV tracking in 1D}

Using the one-dimensional always-in-range UAV tracking problem as a starting point, the problem structure can be developed. The problem requires us to maximize the duration in which the UAV is within a certain region around a reference trajectory, therefore we can establish the objective to be 

$$ J = -t_f $$

In one dimension, this region can be entirely described by $\delta$ and $x_t$, which are the tracking radius and the target trajectory. To enforce this condition a path constraint can be added described by:

$$ (x - x_t)^2 - \delta^2 \leq 0$$
