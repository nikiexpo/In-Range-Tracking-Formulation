# Tracking In Range vs Setpoint Tracking 

Traditional optimal control formulations enforce the tracker to track a reference trajectory by formulating the objective function to minimise the error between the reference and tracker trajectory. However, set point tracking can be energy expensive. When an energy in the system is constrained, the objective function can be formulated to minimise energy expenditure when a certain tracking error threshold is met.
