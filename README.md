# In-Range trackign Formulation 

The main aim of this project is to apply Trajectory Optimisation to Target-In-Range problems. There has been previous work done regarding these problems however they only explore these problems in the context of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) therefore this project will also address this specificity and try to generalise and abstract the underlying structure. Finally, use the structure or properties revealed in the abstraction to solve at least two examples of Target-In-Range problems in two different contexts. 


## Note
The repository needs a clean up that will be done soonish. The README will also be updated then, meanwhile, you can find details in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.03066v1)
